Parser and lexer:

* Support for parentheses
* Type casts
* Trinary operator ?:
* Unicode identifiers and string literals
* Locking / concurrency control
* In string literals, support the "\000" syntax (Octal ASCII
  character) from C89; or perhaps some syntax for specifying Unicode
  code points?

Broader issues:

* Testing
* Error handling
