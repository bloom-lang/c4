Parser and lexer:

* Support for parentheses
* Type casts
* Aggregation
* Trinary operator ?:
* Allow location specifiers to be attached to constants
* Unicode identifiers and string literals
* Locking / concurrency control
* In string literals, support the "\000" syntax (Octal ASCII
  character) from C89; or perhaps some syntax for specifying Unicode
  code points?

Planner:
* Generate implied equalities from the qualifier list

Broader issues:

* Testing
* Error handling
* Add a "$LOCALHOST" variable that expands to the network address of
  the evaluating COL instance
